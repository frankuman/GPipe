GPipe is a Gerrit Analysis Pipeline</p><p align="center"> 
Gpipe was made by Oliver BÃ¶lin during a university course at Blekinge Tekniska University (BTH)

The major objective is to develop a working analysis pipeline that extracts code reviews from
Gerrit, it should also be able to analyse the data extracted and visualise some extracted
metrics. Some minor objectives that I choose to be included is to deliver a decent UX.

Welcome to GPipe! 
GPipe is not that sophisticated and should not be that hard to learn!

Time settings - Here you can set the time for your search, default is current time-1 day

Graph settings - Here you can choose the X-axis and if you want to popout pyplot

Generate graph - If you have made a run you can now generate a graph on that data, you can also change the x-axis in graph settings

Generate PDF - If you have made a run you can now generate a PDF on that data, you can also change the x-axis in graph settings

Generate EXCEL - If you have made a run you can now generate a EXCEL on that data

Platform picker - Here you choose one of the platforms. I have

not added authentication but it could probably be done easily, 
chromium and android is a bit slower than OpenDEV

is: - Choose a metric, or none, if none it searches all changes.

/ Crawl - If you have made a run, search that data with the inputed text

/ Run - run GPipe with current settings

/ Quit - Quit GPipe
