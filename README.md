GPipe is a work in progress school project</p><p align="center"> 
The major objective is to develop a working analysis pipeline that extracts code reviews from
Gerrit, it should also be able to analyse the data extracted and visualise some extracted
metrics. Some minor objectives that should be included is to deliver a decent UX, so most
users can use GPipe even if they’ve never used Python before, create a decent setup for the
software so you don’t have to go into the terminal and write weird scripts. Sort and find data
is a key feature that should be implemented.
