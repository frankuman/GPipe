    <li><b>3. </b>pip install -r requirements.txt</li>

 </ul>
    <h2>Run</h2>
  <p>How to run</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>(RECOMMENDED)</b> python main.py</li>
    <li><b>(WINDOWS USERS)</b> If you don't know about Python or pip, you can just make a shortcut of the gpipe1.0.exe and run that shortcut from anywhere</li>
    <li><b>Have fun!</b></li>
     
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>GPipe is not that sophisticated and should not be that hard to learn!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Time settings</b> - Here you can set the time for your search, default is current time-1 day</li>
    <li><b>Graph settings</b> - Here you can choose the X-axis and if you want to popout pyplot</li>
    <li><b>Generate graph</b> - If you have made a run you can now generate a graph on that data, you can also change the x-axis in graph settings</li>
    <li><b>Generate PDF</b> - If you have made a run you can now generate a PDF on that data, you can also change the x-axis in graph settings</li>
    <li><b>Generate EXCEL</b> - If you have made a run you can now generate an EXCEL on that data</li>
    <li><b>Platform picker</b> - Here you choose one of the platforms. I have not added authentication but it could probably be done easily, chromium and android is a bit slower than OpenDEV</li>
    <li><b>is:</b> - Choose a metric, or none, if none it searches all changes.</li>
    <li><b>/ Crawl</b> - Input a username or similar stuff</li>
